# Contractor installation CRM

In this project three users based CRM will be implemented(in a nutshell)

1) An admin who can manage everything(like add/remove/update contractors or assign/update a customers to a contractors).
2) A contractors will only have access to all the customers who have assigned to them. They can manage assigned customer like sending accepting the job, rejecting the job, quoting a installation cost, scheduling a installation date and more.
3) A customer however will only can track the progress/status of the installation job so far(like job sent to contractor,Job Accepted, Job quoted, Accepting the quote, Booking a date and so on. )
